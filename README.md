# Volume-and-Brightness-Controll-using-HandGesture
This project implements a system that allows users to control the volume and screen brightness of their devices using hand gestures. The system utilizes computer vision techniques to detect and interpret hand gestures in real-time, providing a touch-free way to adjust these settings.

Features
Volume Control: Adjust the volume of your device using specific hand gestures.
Brightness Control: Modify the screen brightness using simple hand movements.
Real-time Detection: Uses your webcam to detect hand gestures in real-time.
Cross-Platform Support: Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux.
Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
OpenCV
Mediapipe
NumPy
You can install the required Python libraries using pip:
 pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy

Installation
Clone the repository:
 git clone https://github.com/your-username/volume-brightness-gesture-control.git
cd volume-brightness-gesture-control
Run the main script:
python main.py

How It Works
Hand Detection: The system uses the Mediapipe library to detect the hand and track its landmarks in real-time.
Gesture Recognition: Specific gestures are mapped to volume and brightness control. For example:
Volume Up: Move your hand up.
Volume Down: Move your hand down.
Brightness Up: Move your hand to the right.
Brightness Down: Move your hand to the left.
Action Execution: Based on the recognized gestures, the system will adjust the volume or brightness of your device accordingly.
Customization
You can easily customize the gestures and the corresponding actions by modifying the gesture recognition logic in main.py.
